# HolbertonSchool HBnB Project 🏰

A comprehensive vacation rental platform similar to Airbnb, demonstrating the evolution from simple API to full-stack web application. This project showcases three distinct versions, each building upon the previous with enhanced features, better architecture, and improved user experience.

## 📖 Project Overview

The HBnB (HolbertonBnB) project is a learning-focused recreation of Airbnb's core functionality, built incrementally across three versions to demonstrate software development evolution, architectural patterns, and full-stack development principles.

### Core Concept
A platform for booking unique accommodations, featuring:
- **User Management**: Registration, authentication, and profile management
- **Place Listings**: Property management with descriptions, pricing, and location data
- **Review System**: User feedback and rating system
- **Amenity Management**: Property features and services
- **Search & Discovery**: Finding the perfect accommodation

## 🔄 Version Evolution
